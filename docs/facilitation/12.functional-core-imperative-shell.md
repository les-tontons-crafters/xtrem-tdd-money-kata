By using `immutability`, `monads` in our `domain` we have already implemented a `Functional Core`.

Let's go a little further by using a more functional language for our `Functional Core`:
- for `java` let's use `kotlin`
- for `C#` let's use `F#`

We will make our system `polyglot` in terms of programming language.
